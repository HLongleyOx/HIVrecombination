HIV Recombination Analysis
This repository contains code for analysing HIV recombination rates using linkage disequilibrium, following the RATSLD method (Romero and Feder 2024).
The scripts include an R script to run SLIM slimuations for different starting conditions, a python script to convert SLIM .txt to .fasta files, a python script to identify diverse sites in linkage and calculate LD over time ;  an R script to implement the RATS-LD method to infer recombination rates (Romero and Feder 2024) 

Data Access
Due to size limitations, data files are not included in this repository. Please contact the author harriet.longley [at] ndm [dot] ox [dot] ac [dot] uk for the simulation data
The data includes:
SLIM simulation outputs for different recombination rates
Sequence alignments - SLIM.txt converted to fasta
Linkage disequilibrium calculations - LD between diverse sites in simulated sequences/
