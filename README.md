HIV Recombination Analysis
This repository contains code for analysing HIV recombination rates using linkage disequilibrium, following the RATSLD method (Romero and Feder 2024).


Data Access
Due to size limitations, data files are not included in this repository. 
The data includes:

SLIM simulation outputs for different recombination rates
Sequence alignments - SLIM.txt converted to fasta
Linkage disequilibrium calculations - LD between diverse sites in simulated sequences/
